Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When ‘git init’ is used to initialize a repository, it transforms the current folder into a git repository and creates the git metadata in the .git folder that may be used while performing git commands.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area comprises of files that are ready to be committed, which have to be selectively determined by the user. It offers the benefits of determining a selection of files that must be included within a specific commit - those which comprise of significant logical changes rather than including all files at once, which may cause redundancy.
